## Server

You can replace [start-mycroft.sh](https://github.com/Joanguitar/HiveMind-voice-sat/blob/master/useful_scripts/server/start-mycroft.sh) in the Mycroft folder to ignore the voice and enclosure services as core services.

## Client

You use [install.sh](https://github.com/Joanguitar/HiveMind-voice-sat/blob/master/useful_scripts/client/install.sh)/[install.bat](https://github.com/Joanguitar/HiveMind-voice-sat/blob/master/useful_scripts/client/install.bat) to install this package in a virtual environment.

You can edit [run.sh](https://github.com/Joanguitar/HiveMind-voice-sat/blob/master/useful_scripts/client/run.sh)/[run.bat](https://github.com/Joanguitar/HiveMind-voice-sat/blob/master/useful_scripts/client/run.bat) to fit the configuration of your HiveMind-skill and run it.
